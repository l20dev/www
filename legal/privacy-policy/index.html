            A data-bookshop-live enables live editing previews in CloudCannon.
            To enable live previews of new components, we render all components
            via a page component that expects an array of content blocks.

            data-bookshop-props is used to control what front matter to bind to.
            Here we want to bind to all the front matter, so that page.content_blocks
            is accessible from the bookshop renderer.

            This element will get picked up by the bookshop dev renderer if present,
            on production this does nothing.

These third parties provide us with automation, customer relationship management, and database management platforms and software as a service. These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform specific tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use your Personal Information for any other purpose. Transfers to third parties are covered by the provisions of this Privacy Policy regarding notice and choice, the service agreements with our Customers, and our contracts with such third parties.</p>
