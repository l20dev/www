Such third-party services are not under our control, and we are not responsible for their use of Subscriber's exported information.</span><br/>
<span class="pl-2">3.5 <u>Ownership; Proprietary Rights</u>. The Lean20 Services are owned and operated by Lean20. The visual interfaces, graphics, design, compilation, information, data, computer code (including source code or object code), products, software, services, and all other elements of the Lean20 Services (the "**Materials**") provided by Lean20 are protected by all relevant intellectual property and proprietary rights and applicable laws.

We will use reasonable efforts to provide you notice of any such suspension or termination. You agree that Lean20 shall not be liable to you or any third-party for any such suspension or termination.</span><br/>

<span class="pl-2">7.5 <u>Limited Remedy</u>. This Section 7 states Lean20's sole and exclusive liability, and Subscriber's sole and exclusive remedy, for the actual or alleged infringement or misappropriation of any third-party intellectual property right by the Lean20 Services.</span>

EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9 WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY IN THIS AGREEMENT.</span>

**10. DATA**<br/>
<span class="pl-2">10.1 <u>Collection of Platform User Data</u>. Subscriber agrees and acknowledges that (a) the Lean20 Services automatically log all user activity conducted on the Lean20 Services, and (b) except for any Subscriber Data, Lean20 owns all right, title and interest in and to this data ("**Services Use Data**"). Lean20 will not publicly disclose any Services Use Data in a manner that would reasonably likely identify Subscriber as being the source of such Services Use Data.</span><br/>
<span class="pl-2">10.2 <u>User Data</u>. Subscriber owns all right, title and interest in and to the User Data. "User Data" means any data or information provided by Subscriber or accessed by Lean20, in connection with Subscriber's use of the Lean20 Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lean20 receives from Subscriber a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide right and license to access, process, store, and otherwise use anonymous, de-identified data (i.e., in a form that cannot be used itself to identify Subscriber or an individual) for any lawful purpose, including benchmarking, aggregate data scoring services, and validation services.</span><br/>
<span class="pl-2">10.3 <u>Privacy Policy</u>. Please read the Lean20 Privacy Policy carefully for information relating to our collection, use, storage and disclosure of Subscriber's personal information. The Lean20 Privacy Policy is hereby incorporated by reference into, and made a part of, this Agreement.</span><br/>
<span class="pl-2">10.4 <u>Additional Terms</u>. Subscriber's use of the Lean20 Services is subject to any and all additional terms, policies, rules, or guidelines applicable to the Lean20 Services or certain features of the Lean20 Services that Lean20 may post on or link to on the Lean20 Services (the "**Additional Terms**"), such as rules applicable to particular features or content on the Lean20 Services. All such Additional Terms are hereby incorporated by reference into, and made a part of, this Agreement.</span>

**11. PRIVACY POLICY**<br/>
Please read the Lean20 Privacy Policy (available at <a href="https://lean20.com/legal/privacy-policy.html">https://lean20.com/legal/privacy-policy.html</a>)for information relating to our collection, use, storage and disclosure of Subscriber's personal information. The Lean20 Privacy Policy is hereby incorporated by reference into, and made a part of, this Agreement.

**12. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION**<br/>
Both Parties will retain in confidence all information disclosed by the other party that is designated at the time of disclosure as proprietary or confidential ("Confidential Information"). Contact Data is Subscriber's Confidential Information. Pricing information and product roadmap information is Lean20's Confidential Information. Confidential Information does not include information that: (a) is or becomes generally known to the public through no fault of or breach of this Agreement; (b) is rightfully known at the time of disclosure without an obligation of confidentiality; (c) is independently developed by either party without use of or reference to Confidential Information; or (d) is rightfully obtained from a third-party without restriction on use or disclosure.

**13. GENERAL**<br/>
<span class="pl-2">13.1 <u>Relationship</u>. Lean20 will be and act as an independent contractor (and not as the agent or representative of Subscriber) in the performance of this Agreement.</span><br/>
<span class="pl-2">13.2 <u>Assignability</u>. Neither party may assign its right, duties, and obligations under this Agreement without the other party's prior written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except that a party may assign this Agreement without the other party's consent to a successor (including a successor by way of merger, acquisition, sale of assets, or operation of law) if the successor agrees to assume and fulfill all of the assigning party's obligations under this Agreement.</span><br/>
<span class="pl-2">13.3 <u>Subcontractors</u>. Lean20 may utilize a subcontractor or other third-party to perform its duties under this Agreement so long as Lean20 remains responsible for all of its obligations under this Agreement.</span><br/>
<span class="pl-2">13.4 <u>Force Majeure</u>. Neither party will be liable for, or be considered to be in breach of or default under this Agreement on account of, any delay or failure to perform as required by this Agreement as a result of any cause or condition beyond its reasonable control, so long as that party uses all commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or remove the causes of non-performance.</span><br/>
<span class="pl-2">13.5 <u>Governing Law</u>. This Agreement will be interpreted, construed, and enforced in all respects in accordance with the local laws of the State of Washington, U.S.A., without reference to its choice of law rules and not including the provisions of the 1980 U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. Subscriber and Lean20 agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within King County, Washington for the purpose of litigating all such disputes.</span><br/>
<span class="pl-2">13.6 <u>Waiver</u>. The waiver by either party of any breach of any provision of this Agreement does not waive any other breach. The failure of any party to insist on strict performance of any covenant or obligation in accordance with this Agreement will not be a waiver of such party's right to demand strict compliance in the future, nor will the same be construed as a novation of this Agreement.</span><br/>
<span class="pl-2">13.7 <u>Severability</u>. If any part of this Agreement is found to be illegal, unenforceable, or invalid, the remaining portions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. If any material limitation or restriction on the use of the Lean20 Services under this Agreement is found to be illegal, unenforceable, or invalid, Subscriber's right to use the Lean20 Services will immediately terminate.</span><br/>
<span class="pl-2">13.8 <u>Interpretation</u>. The headings appearing at the beginning of several sections contained in this Agreement have been inserted for identification and reference purposes only and must not be used to construe or interpret this Agreement. Whenever required by context, a singular number will include the plural, the plural number will include the singular, and the gender of any pronoun will include all genders. Any reference to any agreement, document or instrument will mean such agreement, document or instrument as amended or modified and in effect from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they will be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." Whenever the words "hereunder," "hereof," "hereto," and words of similar import are used in this Agreement, they will be deemed references to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular Article, Section or other provision hereof. The word "or" is used in the inclusive sense of "and/or." The terms "or," "any" and "either" are not exclusive.</span><br/>
<span class="pl-2">13.9 <u>Consent to Electronic Communications</u>. By using the Lean20 Service, Subscriber consents to receiving certain electronic communications from Lean20 as further described in its Privacy Policy. Subscriber agrees that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that Lean20 sends to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that such communications be in writing.</span><br/>
<span class="pl-2">13.10 <u>Contact Information</u>. The Lean20 Services are offered by Lean20, LLC, 10608 106th Pl NE, Kirkland, WA 98033. Subscriber may contact Lean20 by sending correspondence to the foregoing address or by emailing Lean20 at hello@lean20.com.</span><br/>
<span class="pl-2">13.11 <u>Entire Agreement</u>. This Agreement (including each Service Order) is the final and complete expression of the agreement between these parties regarding Subscriber's use of the Lean20 Services. This Agreement supersedes, and the terms of this Agreement govern, all previous oral and written communications regarding these matters, all of which are merged into this Agreement, except that this Agreement does not supersede any terms explicitly added to each Service Order, or any prior nondisclosure or comparable agreement between the parties executed prior to this Agreement being executed. No employee, agent, or other representative of Lean20 has any authority to bind Lean20 with respect to any statement, representation, warranty, or other expression unless the same is specifically set forth in this Agreement. No usage of trade or other regular practice or method of dealing between the parties will be used to modify, interpret, supplement, or alter the terms of this Agreement. Lean20 will not be bound by, and specifically objects to, any term, condition, or other provision that is different from or in addition to this Agreement (whether or not it would materially alter this Agreement) that is proffered by Subscriber in any receipt, acceptance, confirmation, correspondence, or otherwise, unless Lean20 specifically agrees to such provision in writing and signed by an authorized agent of Lean20.</span>
