          <p>Raising prices is a common strategy to enable revenue growth.
          Justification for increased price for existing customers comes via new
          features and capabilities.</p><p>This makes most products expensive,
          unnecessarily complex, and built for maximum revenue rather than
          maximum value.</p><p><strong>Our goal is to provide lean, and highly
          targeted software for the lowest price possible.</strong></p>
