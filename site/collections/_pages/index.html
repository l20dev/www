      <h2 class="align-to-center">The Lean20 Vision</h2><p><strong>The idea is
      simple.</strong><br />Venture-scale companies are pressured with
      relentless pursuit of revenue growth which has an inevitable impact on
      software complexity and price.</p><p><strong>Commodity
      services.</strong><br />Cloud computing allows us to reduce many products
      to only the features truly needed for the lowest possible
      price.</p><p><strong>The 80/20 rule.</strong><br />80% of software
      features are used by less than 20% of users. Our focus is eliminating
      those, supporting only the highest value
      functionality.</p><p><strong>Bootstrapped and hand-crafted.</strong><br
      />We never outsource development. We are built with love from Seattle and
      have the experience and passion to keep it that way.</p>
